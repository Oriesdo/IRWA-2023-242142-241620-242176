Part 1: Text Processing and Exploratory Data Analysis
We have structured the code in the following way:
	1. Packages and imports: this section contains all the necessary libraries and imports.
	2. Load Data to Memory: the json file is loaded and stored in a dataframe.
	3. Pre-processing of documents: the whole dataframe is processed (remove punctuation marks, tokenization, stemming,...).
	4. Exploratory Data Analysis: implementation of the different analysis performed.

Code is load and run, it doesn't ask for any input
You can find comments on every cell of the code, so explanations of what is being done is in the .ipynb file
